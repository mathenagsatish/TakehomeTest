# TLV Server
## Design & Assumptions Made.
The server is designed as a multi-threaded TCP server that listens on a specified port and handles multiple clients concurrently. Each client connection is accepted on the main listening socket and then processed in a dedicated thread, where the server reads a simple TLV (Type-Length-Value) protocol.The server supports three message types: Hello, Data, and Goodbye.

Logging is centralized through a singleton Logger so all client threads can safely write output. 

Connections are closed 
    1. Either when a Goodbye message is received
    2. The client is idle longer than the configured timeout
    3. When Error/Unknown Messages received.
    4. When the server shuts down. Shutdown is handled by a signal handler that stops accepting new connections, closes the listening socket, and then closes all active client sockets in an orderly fashion.
    
## Build
### Server
#### Cmake
    # go to tlv_server folder
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make

## Run Server
    ./tlv_server PORT 
    ex: ./tlv_server 5222

#### or 
    g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Iinclude src/main.cpp src/logger.cpp src/server.cpp -o tlv_server
    

# TLV Client(for testing)
## How it works. 
The tlv_client is a TCP client that connects to a server using sockets, formats messages in Type-Length-Value (TLV) format, and can spawn multiple threads to simulate concurrent connections for load or stress testing. Itâ€™s mainly used to send TLV requests and validate server handling under parallel traffic.

## Build
#### Client
    # go to tlv_client folder
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make

#### or 
    g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Isrc src/main.cpp src/client.cpp src/tlv.cpp -o tlv_client
    
## Run Test Client.
 Follow client_run_instructions.txt
 
 Here are the examples from there. 
### Examples
### Short-lived clients

    1 short client
    ./tlv_client 5111 short

    50 parallel short clients
    ./tlv_client 5111 short 50

### Long-lived clients

    1 long client, runs 30s, sending every 5s
    ./tlv_client 5111 long
    
    20 long clients, each 60s, TLV every 10s
    ./tlv_client 5111 long 20 60 10

### Burst clients

    1 burst client, 100 TLVs of 15 bytes (default)
    ./tlv_client 5111 burst
    
    100 burst clients, each sends 1000 TLVs of 64 bytes
    ./tlv_client 5111 burst 100 1000 64

### Mixed clients

    1 mixed client
    ./tlv_client 5111 mixed
    
    20 parallel mixed clients
    ./tlv_client 5111 mixed 20

### Scenario (combination)
    
    Default mix: 10 short, 5 long, 5 buggy short, 5 buggy long
    ./tlv_client 5111 scenario
    
    Custom mix: 50 short, 20 long, 10 buggy short, 10 buggy long
    ./tlv_client 5111 scenario 50 20 10 10
